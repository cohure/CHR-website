### This website is under revision, and the 2021 CFP will soon be published - stay tuned!
<!-- ### Description -->
<!-- In the humanities and related social sciences, the use of computational, statistical, and -->
<!-- mathematical approaches has increased in recent years. The research can be characterized -->
<!-- by (i) relying on quantifiable rather than strictly qualitative evidence; (ii) making -->
<!-- explicit and formalizing theory with the help of mathematical and computational -->
<!-- models; (iii) making statistical inferences about model parameters; (iv) the use of -->
<!-- computational and automatic procedures for processing and analyzing data; and (v) -->
<!-- searching for computational analogies through which theories from different disciplines -->
<!-- can be unified. And yet, despite the undeniable growth of this new research area, many -->
<!-- scholars still feel that there is no suitable research-oriented venue to present and -->
<!-- publish their computational work that does not lose sight of questions relevant to the -->
<!-- humanities. As such, we aim to fill this niche by creating a community for Computational -->
<!-- Humanities Research. Ultimately, the goal of the community is to set up a -->
<!-- research-oriented, open-access computational humanities journal. This workshop on -->
<!-- Computational Humanities Research (CHR) will serve as a stepping stone to this journal. -->

<!-- Read the accepted papers <a href="/papers">here</a> or at <a -->
